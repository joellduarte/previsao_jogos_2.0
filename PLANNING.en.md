## Simulation Engine

### Simulation Factors
1. **Basic Statistics**:
   - Average goals scored/conceded
   - Accumulated points
   - Table position

2. **Performance Factors**:
   - Home/away performance (weight: 20%)
   - Recent form (weight: 30%)
   - Team consistency (weight: 20%)
   - Overall history (weight: 30%)

3. **Probability Adjustments**:
   - Head-to-head (weight: 15%)
   - Form trend (weight: 15%)
   - Home advantage (10% bonus on expected goals)

4. **Advanced Calculations**:
   - Poisson distribution for goals
   - Recent matches weighting
   - Confidence intervals for positions
   - Moving average for form

### Probability Calculations
1. **Attack/Defense Strength**:
   - Attack: team's average goals scored √∑ league average
   - Defense: team's average goals conceded √∑ league average

2. **Expected Goals**:
   - For home team:
     ```
     homeExpectedGoals = LEAGUE_AVG_HOME_GOALS * homeAttackStrength * awayDefenseStrength * HOME_ADVANTAGE
     ```
   - For away team:
     ```
     awayExpectedGoals = LEAGUE_AVG_AWAY_GOALS * awayAttackStrength * homeDefenseStrength
     ```
   - Constants:
     - `LEAGUE_AVG_HOME_GOALS = 1.5`
     - `LEAGUE_AVG_AWAY_GOALS = 1.0`
     - `HOME_ADVANTAGE = 1.1`

3. **Poisson Distribution**:
   - Formula: `P(k; Œª) = (Œª^k * e^(-Œª)) / k!`
   - Calculated for 0 to 4 goals per team
   - Pre-calculated probabilities for optimization

### Simulation Process
1. Load CSV data
2. Calculate attack/defense strength for each team
3. For each match:
   - Calculate probabilities
   - Draw result
   - Apply adjustments based on form and history
4. Repeat for all rounds
5. Aggregate final statistics

## Usage Flow
1. User accesses the home page
2. Sets desired number of simulations
3. Starts simulation
4. Views real-time progress
5. Receives detailed results:
   - Most likely table
   - Possible variations
   - Position probabilities

## Next Steps
